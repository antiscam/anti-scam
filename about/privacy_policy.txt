<h1>Use of Cookies</h1>
<p>
The A0S website may use "cookies" to help you personalize your online experience. A cookie is a
text file that is placed on your hard disk by a web page server. Cookies cannot be used to run
programs or deliver viruses to your computer. Cookies are uniquely assigned to you, and can only
be read by a web server in the domain that issued the cookie to you.
One of the primary purposes of cookies is to provide a convenience feature to save you time. The
purpose of a cookie is to tell the Web server that you have returned to a specific page. For
example, if you personalize A0S pages, or register with A0S site or services, a cookie helps A0S
to recall your specific information on subsequent visits. This simplifies the process of recording
your personal information, such as billing addresses, shipping addresses, and so on. When you
return to the same A0S website, the information you previously provided can be retrieved, so you
can easily use the A0S features that you customized.
You have the ability to accept or decline cookies. Most Web browsers automatically accept
cookies, but you can usually modify your browser setting to decline cookies if you prefer. If you
choose to decline cookies, you may not be able to fully experience the interactive features of the
A0S services or websites you visit.</p>
